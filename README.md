# BLE-Beacon-Tracking-System


Indoor Beacon Tracking system based on Bluetooth Low Energy and Beacon technology. It can be installed on any Linux based Micro-computer such as Raspberry Pi or DragonBoard. It identifies each UUID of the beacons and utilizes Python multi-threading to record the entry time, exit time, duration in the particular area with corresponding event. After that, it sends real-time data to C2M IoT cloud by TCP. Further big data analytics and visualization will provide real-time information.

This system can be expanded based on Triangulation. MQTT or HTTPS can be added as transmission methods.
