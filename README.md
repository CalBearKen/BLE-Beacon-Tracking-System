# BLE-Beacon-Tracking-System

Bully Beacon (B^2) is an APP that constantly allows for positive growth in the student body by limiting bullying on campus and creating an incentive for students and teachers to step in when they see cases of bullying occurring. 
The APP contains a map that is able to track the locations of students and teachers alike using beacon sensors. 
If someone alerts that they are being bullied by clicking the ALERT button, they then display their location so that students and teachers in the cloud are notified and can then help to resolve the situation. 
As a specific person helps more people and catalogs this in the APP, they can receive more rewards and gain more points. 
This encourages a system that leverages crowd sourcing thus pushing the student community to become more positively interactive with each other and further 'hero' behavior, in a game-like setting. We utilize Qualcomm - DragonBoard, AT&T EPTT & Data Rewards API,Gimbal Beacons & C2M platform.

Indoor Beacon Tracking system based on Bluetooth Low Energy and Beacon technology. It can be installed on any Linux based Micro-computer such as Raspberry Pi or DragonBoard. It identifies each UUID of the beacons and utilizes multi-threading to record the entry time, exit time, duration in the particular area with corresponding event. After that, it sends real-time data to C2M cloud by TCP. Further big data analytics and visualization will provide real-time information.
